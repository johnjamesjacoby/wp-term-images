# FAQ

### Does this plugin depend on any others?

Not since WordPress 4.4.

### Does this create new database tables?

No. There are no new database tables with this plugin.

### Does this modify existing database tables?

No. All of WordPress's core database tables remain untouched.

### How do I get the image for a term?

With WordPress's `get_term_meta()` function

```
// image id is stored as term meta
$image_id = get_term_meta( 7, 'image', true );

// image data stored in array, second argument is which image size to retrieve
$image_data = wp_get_attachment_image_src( $image_id, 'full' );

// image url is the first item in the array (aka 0)
$image = $image_data[0];

if ( ! empty( $image ) ) {
	echo '<img src="' . esc_url( $image ) . '" />';
}
```
### Available filters

Throughout the plugin filters are reffered to as ```"filter_name_{$this->meta_key}_definition"``` where the $this->meta is in this plugin "image", creating the filter name of "filter_name_image_definition". This is setup this way so that the WP_Term_Meta_UI can be reused with all meta data adaptions. 

| filter name                                        | Type of data | What it does                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "wp_term_{$this->meta_key}_allowed_taxonomies" | array        | Array of all taxonomies that will have this plugins UI applied to it |
| "wp_term_{$this->meta_key}_get_taxonomies"     | array        | Allow filters of affected taxonomies                              |
| "wp_fancy_term_{$this->meta_key}"              | bool         | A simple filter to allow for UI variations                        |
